Optimizing Oxygen Levels in Electric Arc Furnace
This project focuses on optimizing the oxygen levels in an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). The EAF is a key component in the steel-making process, where electricity is used to melt metal scrap. Oxygen levels during this process are critical for efficient desoxidation, which impacts the quality of the final product.

Objective
The main goal of this project is to predict and optimize the oxygen levels in the EAF by analyzing the chemical compositions of each metal batch entering the furnace. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to improve the control over oxygen levels, leading to better energy efficiency and higher-quality steel production.

Key Findings
Silicon, Phosphorus, and Carbon play a significant role in the desoxidation process, influencing oxygen levels.
By analyzing the chemical composition of the metal batches, we created distinct groups, some of which have a higher likelihood of producing higher-quality output.
Methodology
Classification Algorithms: Used to predict the quality of the metal batch based on its chemical composition.
Clustering Algorithms: Employed to group the batches based on their chemical properties, which helps identify patterns and trends in the data.
Data Preprocessing: Various techniques were applied to clean and prepare the data, ensuring that it was suitable for machine learning modeling.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle - Industrial Data from the Arc Furnace, which contains data on the composition, temperature, and oxygen levels during the operation of an electric arc furnace.

Conclusion
The project has provided valuable insights into the EAF process, particularly how specific elements in the chemical composition affect oxygen levels and, ultimately, the quality of the metal. These findings can help optimize operations, reduce energy consumption, and enhance product quality in the steel-making industry.
